    <h2>Some dishes in a certain cuisine are known to best describe the feeling of home-cooked meals from that particular country. For the Philippines, it can range from sinigang to fried bangus to longganisa. But Ginisang Munggo is perhaps one of the best standout dishes that can definitely bring to you the comfort of a Filipino home. Hearty, healthy, and made of affordable ingredients, this dish isn’t so often cooked and served by moms for nothing. </h2>
    <p>It has a subtle, savory taste, and a satisfyingly tender texture. The mix of softened munggo or Mung beans with spinach, tomatoes, onions, and pork definitely make for a tasty and filling lunch meal.  And because it mainly banks on so many vegetables to fill the pan, it also has a ton of nutrients like folate and phosphorus. </p>
    <p>But if you’re looking for a vegetarian alternative, Ginisang Munggo without meat is also possible. Simply subtract your thinly sliced pork, shrimp and crushed pork rinds from the equation. You can expect an altogether delicious dish even without these meat additions. </p>
